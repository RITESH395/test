My driver program is a main method.
Input should be provided in format (Type,Price,Quantity)

Enter stop to discontinue the input loop.

Driver method takes input
Helper Class for data as per requirement
Created POJO for input Format
Created Enum for OrderType since Order type can be a custom data structure(can be restricted to buy/sell only).
Service does all the calculation part.
